# JUSTIFY
my first local hackathon on my university.
Justify is a platform designed to make legal guidance more accessible by connecting people with solutions that fit their specific situation.

## The Problem
In Mexico, navigating the legal system is a major challenge for many. Statistics show that while nearly half of the population has faced a legal issue in recent years, only a small percentage actually seeks professional help. This often happens because students and workers don't have a secure or easy way to get advice, leading to unnecessary stress and missed opportunities for both citizens and lawyers.

##  Solution
I created Justify as a secure channel where anyone can clear up their legal doubts. The project features "Ikal," an AI assistant that helps guide users through their cases before connecting them with professional legal support. The goal is to provide a reliable space for people to handle administrative or labor issues with confidence.

## Project Structure
The repository includes a web application built with Python and Flask:
* `app.py`: The main logic of the application.
* `chat.py` & `personalidad.py`: Core files managing the AI assistant's behavior.
* `templates/` & `static/`: Frontend files for the chatbot interface and design.
